## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Users should feel confident, efficient, and in control when generating complex technical documentation.

**Design Personality**: Professional and sophisticated, like advanced aerospace software - clean, precise, with subtle high-tech elements that reinforce the advanced AI capabilities.

**Visual Metaphors**: Industrial design language inspired by aerospace interfaces, with subtle gradients and glassmorphic elements suggesting advanced AI processing.

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with progressive disclosure - powerful capabilities available when needed without overwhelming basic workflows.

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with accent complementary
**Primary Color**: Deep aerospace blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - communicates reliability and technical precision
**Secondary Colors**: Subtle blue-grays for supporting UI elements
**Accent Color**: Vibrant cyan (oklch(0.7 0.18 200)) - for AI processing indicators and active states
**Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and technical competence, cyan suggests innovation and AI intelligence

**Color Accessibility**: All text combinations exceed WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 contrast ratio)

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- Primary text on background: oklch(0.2 0.02 240) on oklch(0.98 0.02 240) - 18.5:1 contrast
- Button text on primary: oklch(0.98 0.02 240) on oklch(0.45 0.15 240) - 9.2:1 contrast
- Secondary text on card: oklch(0.5 0.02 240) on oklch(1 0 0) - 8.1:1 contrast

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI text (clean, technical) paired with JetBrains Mono for code/nomenclature display

**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- Headers: 24px/28px bold Inter
- Body: 14px/20px regular Inter  
- Code: 13px/18px JetBrains Mono
- Labels: 12px/16px medium Inter, uppercase with letter-spacing

**Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern technical precision, JetBrains Mono ensures nomenclature codes are highly legible

**Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights) and JetBrains Mono (400, 500 weights) from Google Fonts

**Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested at small sizes, high contrast maintained throughout

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Progressive left-to-right flow: template selection → generation controls → output preview → collaboration tools

**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing creates calm, professional feel while grouping related functionality clearly

**Grid System**: 24px base unit grid with responsive breakpoints at 768px and 1200px

**Content Density**: Balanced - enough information visible without overwhelming, with expandable detail views

### Animations & Motion
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations reinforce AI processing and collaborative awareness
- Loading states show AI thinking
- Cursor movements indicate collaboration
- Smooth transitions maintain spatial relationships

**Hierarchy of Movement**: 
1. Critical AI processing indicators (pulse, progress)
2. Collaborative presence (cursor movements, typing indicators)  
3. UI transitions (tab switches, modal appearances)

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**:
- Tabs for template library organization
- Dialog modals for generation workflow
- Cards for template and document display
- Progress indicators for AI generation steps
- Avatar groups for collaboration presence

**Spacing System**: 4px base unit (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40px scale)

**Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive grid collapses to single column, collaborative editing switches to tabbed interface

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum, targeting AAA where possible
- All text meets 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements have 3:1 minimum
- Focus indicators are clearly visible
- Screen reader friendly markup structure

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**:
- Large document generation timeouts
- Collaborative editing conflicts
- Repository connection failures
- Invalid nomenclature formats

**Edge Case Handling**:
- Progressive generation with cancellation options
- Operational transforms for conflict resolution  
- Graceful degradation to local storage
- Smart validation with helpful error messages

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Support for 10+ simultaneous collaborators, documents up to 1MB, template libraries with 100+ items

**Testing Focus**: AI generation accuracy, collaborative conflict resolution, cross-format output fidelity

**Critical Questions**: 
- How to handle LLM generation failures gracefully?
- What's the optimal auto-save frequency for collaboration?
- How to maintain format fidelity across all output types?
