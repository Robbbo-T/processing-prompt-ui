# Processing Prompt UI - Enhanced Workflow System

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Create an AI-powered template generation interface that allows users to generate, review, preview, and publish documentation templates with complete workflow control and format flexibility.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Users can seamlessly move through generation → raw review → preview → formatting → publishing workflow
- Support for multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML5, Word)
- Raw code visibility and editing capabilities
- Professional preview rendering with side-by-side comparison
- Successful repository integration for local and network storage

**Experience Qualities**: Professional, Transparent, Controllable

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with workflow state management)

**Primary User Activity**: Creating and Acting (generating documents with review workflow)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Users need visibility and control over AI-generated content before final publication, with the ability to see raw code, preview rendering, and make informed decisions about format and publication.

**User Context**: Technical and semi-technical users working with aerospace documentation who need confidence in AI-generated content through transparent review processes.

**Critical Path**: Template selection → Configuration → AI generation → Raw code review → Preview rendering → Format preparation → Publication

**Key Moments**: 
1. Raw code review stage where users can inspect and copy generated content
2. Preview comparison between raw code and rendered output
3. Final publication decision with repository selection

## Essential Features

### Multi-Step Generation Workflow
- **What it does**: Provides a 5-step process (Generate → Raw Review → Preview → Format → Publish) with visual progress indication
- **Why it matters**: Gives users complete control and transparency over the generation process
- **Success criteria**: Users can navigate forward/backward through steps, cancel at any point, and see clear progress indicators

### Raw Code Inspection
- **What it does**: Displays generated content in raw format (Markdown/HTML/Word) with syntax highlighting and copy functionality
- **Why it matters**: Allows technical users to verify, inspect, and potentially modify generated content
- **Success criteria**: Raw content is readable, copyable, and accurately reflects what will be processed

### Live Preview Rendering
- **What it does**: Shows side-by-side comparison of raw code and rendered output with tab switching
- **Why it matters**: Users can confirm rendering matches expectations before publication
- **Success criteria**: Preview accurately represents final output, tabs work smoothly, content is scrollable

### Format Selection
- **What it does**: Allows users to choose between Markdown, HTML5, and Word document formats before generation
- **Why it matters**: Different formats serve different use cases and publishing requirements
- **Success criteria**: Format selection affects both generation prompts and preview rendering

### Repository Integration
- **What it does**: Supports both local and network repository paths for document storage
- **Why it matters**: Integration with existing file systems and version control workflows
- **Success criteria**: Documents save to specified locations with proper naming and metadata

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with transparency and control
**Design Personality**: Clean, technical, trustworthy - like a sophisticated development environment
**Visual Metaphors**: Code editor aesthetics, development workflow indicators, professional documentation tools
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface that provides necessary technical detail without overwhelming

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Analogous with technical accent colors
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - professional and trustworthy
**Secondary Colors**: Light blues and grays for backgrounds and supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Warm yellow/orange (oklch(0.7 0.18 50)) for highlights and active states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism, yellow provides energy for interactive elements
**Status Colors**: Green for success/completion, orange for in-progress, red for critical actions

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI text, JetBrains Mono for code display
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and code
**Font Personality**: Inter is clean and professional, JetBrains Mono provides technical credibility
**Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing scale with proper contrast ratios

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Visual workflow indicators guide users through the process
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing around critical decision points and code blocks
**Grid System**: Card-based layout with consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
**Content Density**: Balance between information richness and visual clarity, with expandable details

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions between workflow steps communicate progress
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Subtle hover effects on interactive elements, progress animations for generation
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: Dialog for generation workflow, Tabs for preview switching, Progress for status indication
**Component States**: Clear visual feedback for all interactive elements across different states
**Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for technical actions (Robot, Code, Eye, FileText, Share)
**Spacing System**: Consistent use of Tailwind's spacing scale with generous padding for readability

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Support for additional output formats, integration with version control systems
**Testing Focus**: Workflow state management, preview rendering accuracy, repository integration
**Critical Questions**: How accurate is preview rendering across formats? Can users easily understand workflow progress?

## Reflection

This approach uniquely serves technical users who need confidence in AI-generated content through transparency and control. The workflow-based approach with raw code visibility addresses the trust gap that often exists with AI-generated content, particularly in professional documentation contexts.
